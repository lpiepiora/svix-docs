title: Static Source IP Addresses
---

import sourceIps from "/static/webhook-ips.json";

In case your webhook receiving endpoint is behind a firewall or NAT, you may need to allow traffic from Svix's static IP addresses.

This is the full list of IP addresses that webhooks may originate from grouped by the region of the sender. The list is also available as a JSON file: [webhooks-ips.json](pathname:///webhook-ips.json).

## Regions

The list of IP addresses below is grouped by the respective Svix region. The region where webhooks are sent from is the same as the region of respective environment. This means that all webhooks in the EU region will use the EU IP addresses below, all webhooks in the US region will use the US IP addressed below, and the same for every other region.

### US

<pre>
<code>
{sourceIps["us"].join("\n")}
</code>
</pre>

### EU

<pre>
<code>
{sourceIps["eu"].join("\n")}
</code>
</pre>

### Australia (Private region)

<pre>
<code>
{sourceIps["au"].join("\n")}
</code>
</pre>

### Canada (Private region)

<pre>
<code>
{sourceIps["ca"].join("\n")}
</code>
</pre>

### India (Private region)

<pre>
<code>
{sourceIps["in"].join("\n")}
</code>
</pre>

## Webhook User Agent

Some systems may require to identify the User-Agent used by Svix in addition to the IP addresses. Requests from the Svix service, as well as self-hosted instances, may use different user-agent strings depending on the exact plan and configuration (usually `Svix-Webhooks/{server-version}` or `Webhooks/{server-version}`).

However, every webhook coming from the Svix hosted service (using the IP addresses above), will also include `sender-9YMgn` in order to enable easy identification of requests coming from the hosted service.
